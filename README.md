# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid, where one player uses "X" and the other uses "O." The goal is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three identical symbols before the opponent. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
